# SENTRY CONFIGURATION: change only if you wanna run validator in a sentry architecture
########################################################################################################################
# pex:
#   validator:
#     value: false
#     explanation: Disables peer exchange to keep the validator private and prevent gossiping with the network.
#                  Validator only communicates with its sentry nodes.
#   fullnode:
#     value: true
#     explanation: Enables peer exchange so the sentry node can connect with public peers and discover other nodes.

# persistent_peers:
#   validator:
#     value: List of sentry nodes
#     explanation: Ensures stable connections between the validator and its sentry nodes. No other peer should be added other than your own sentry nodes
#   fullnode:
#     value: Validator node and other sentry nodes
#     explanation: Sentry nodes maintain connections with the validator and optionally other sentries for redundancy.

# private_peer_ids:
#   validator:
#     value: None ("")
#     explanation: Validators do not need to hide who they are communicating with, as they only connect with trusted sentries.
#   fullnode:
#     value: Validator node ID
#     explanation: Marks the validator as a private peer to ensure the validator's IP is not gossiped to the network.

# unconditional_peer_ids:
#   validator:
#     value: Optionally sentry node IDs
#     explanation: Ensures that critical sentry nodes are always connected, even with inbound/outbound limits.
#   fullnode:
#     value: Validator node ID and optionally other sentries
#     explanation: Guarantees continuous connection with the validator, maintaining stability even under restrictions.

# addr_book_strict:
#   validator:
#     value: false
#     explanation: Allows connections from non-routable IPs for private or local communication.
#   fullnode:
#     value: false
#     explanation: Enables connections from non-routable IPs, useful in private network setups.

# seeds:
#   validator:
#     value: None ("")
#     explanation: Validators do not need to connect to seed nodes since they only communicate with sentry nodes.
#   fullnode:
#     value: "can connect to other seeds"
#     explanation: Fullnodes (sentry nodes) can connect to seed nodes to discover peers and maintain connectivity with the network.
